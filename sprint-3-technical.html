          <p>The simplest analogy I've found to explain HTML and CSS is that of a house. Where HTML defines the structure of say element front door - CSS would specify the styling of the front door. For example there is likely many doors in the house but the front door needs to stand out from the Johnsons new blue door across the road so we style it red with a matte finish. However the front door is still a door so it likely inherited some stylings from its parent HTML element of door and using CSS was further classed as the front door and styled appropriately. </p>

          <p>This analogy lends itself well to not only explaining the relationship between structure and styling HTML and CSS share - but also the functionality or interactivity Javascript provides. For example there is likely multiple rooms in the house but each serves a different function depending on what APPlicances we might find there. For example you can sleep on your bed on your bed AND the couch in the lounge but you won't find coffee pods for the machine in the bathroom. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Control Flow, Conditionals and Loops</h2>

          <p>Control flow is the order in which operations are performed in a programming language. In javascript code runs sequentially start to finish often involving an input value and some return or output value. This would be for simple applications like arithmetic but what if we want the computer to make a decision or repeat its task until a decision or condition has been met? </p>

          <p>This is the task of conditional operators and loops. For example say I need to boil the jug to make a hot drink. When I turn the jug on or run the boilJug method on object jug. The jug has a few ways it could achieve the task. It could heat the water for a set or known period of time to boil the water. This would involve a loop to run the electricity for the set time or the condition of timeToBoil had been met. Alternatively a fancier jug might be able to measure the waters temperature and loop through heating the water till it reached a set temperature. </p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">The DOM</h2>

          <a href="img/dom_tree2.jpg">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/dom_tree2.jpg" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">DOM TREENESS</span>

          <p>The DOM or Document Object Model is an API for using Javascript to change a sites HTML. Often referred to as the DOM tree it is useful for viewing the hierarchical nature of HTML elements on a page in that you can easily see  the child-parent-sibling relationships. Using classes and IDs we can use the DOM to dynamically change the front-end of a website using JS and jquery. For example we might build a calendar application and using the DOM make changes to a single day element, a week or even a whole year. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Arrays, Objects and Functions</h2>
          <p>In javascript an array is a variable data structure that holds many variables like a list. Variables in an array are stored at indexes starting from 0. To access the variable in an array we refer to the index of the array using square [ ] brackets. </p>
          
          <p>Objects are similar in that they hold multiple values but these are stored in key value pairs as properties or methods for the object we are modelling. For example if we have an object myCar it might have the properties. color: "brown", age: "old", owner: "Ash" and the methods start: function() {start engine] and stop: function() {stop engine}. To access properties in objects we use dot notation or pass the name of the property we want inside square brackets. e.g mYcar.color === myCar["color"].</p>
          
          <p>Functions are blocks of code that are used to perform a task. They are useful for avoiding redundant code but also for best practises of class inheritance and refactoring. For example myCar might inherit the function paintCar() from its parent class of car. Running paint car using myCar.paintCar("red") will set the value of mYcar.color to "red". Methods are functions stored as parameters on a class. </p>
