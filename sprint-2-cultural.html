          <h1>Learning Objectives</h1>

              <p>My learning objective at EDA is to build up the necessary programming skills to produce a high quality portfolio of web applications. I will be able to draw on past experience working in an agile/SCRUM team environment which will allow me to focus on utilising technologies and frameworks that support web development.

              To accomplish this I will need to have a working knowledge of both frontend(client) and backend(server) JavaScript. This will allow me to navigate the MEAN stack to build JS applications. This will be a good base from which to explore more learning and look to secure a role as a fulltime JS developer.</p>

              <h1>Commitment</h1>

              <p>I am fully committed to completing this course to the best of my ability. I will work hard to deepen my understandings of both the technical and soft skills required to support mine and my class mates development through this learning process.

              I will endeavour to be an approachable and active member of the class and when working in team environments I will be conscientious of others and their commitments. I will treat class mates with respect - irrespective of race, age or gender. 

              I commit to managing my workload by being true to my learning outcomes and maintaining a healthy code-life balance.</p>

              <h1>Strengths and Weaknesses</h1>

              <p>Looking at results I received in strength surveys and talking to friends, colleagues and family. I believe my strengths lie in my ability to deliver. This is evidenced by my former role being tasked to manage small teams and materials over multiple construction projects and also my past achievement of a Computer Science degree. The latter also benefited from my strengths of self-belief and attitude of lifelong learning. Also empathy is a tricky one because it slows me down but is also largely why I believe my Myers-Briggs is significantly different from the last time I did it. I'm prone to being cynical for the sake of argument as I do think its valuable to call things as they are. That said the more I follow my gut and stop overthinking the easier I've found it to the find the positives in most situations. I'm definitely still Tyrion and not Jon though.. He knows nothing.</p>

              <h2>Limitations</h2>

              <p>Previous experience with PHP/LAMP stack and only worked on fairly simple static websites since graduation in 2013</p>

              <h2>Challenges and Expectations</h2>

              <p>Currently I've been doing around 5 hours a day but I would like to schedule this closer to the weekday hours of bootcamp. This routine has already been stretched with scheduling challenges of my sport team commitments. Training Monday and Wednesday evening and games Saturdays - these will take a backseat when bootcamp starts. 
            
              <p>I expect the facilitators to be clear and honest with me throughout foundations and bootcamp. I will benefit from feedback and can take criticism.</p>
