          <h1>Identity</h1>

          <p>An ethical decision I recently had to make is largely the reason I'm in the matai cohort.

              I've been working for an extended period of time in a field not related to my computer science degree which I completed at AUT majoring in Systems science.
              
              Previously my work colleagues were your typical lay types as I worked in a labour over or certified skill intensive construction trade - namely commercial residential exterior painting and plastering.
               
              Recently the work group chat had soured and I was finding myself being triggered by "Casual racism".
              I was confronted with viewpoints I not only disagreed with - I was grossly offended by.
              
              I made the decision to call out these persons comments despite knowing they weren't necessarily their core values and beliefs. Largely to set an example to others in the group and outline my own opinion and intolerance for such behaviour. 
              
              The Friday of that week was March 15th. I handed in my notice the following Friday after the video of the terrorist attack was shared in the group chat. 2 weeks later after 6 months of planning and a few years of procrastinating I'm here at EDA starting the next chapter of my life. FULL TIME CODING</p>

          <h1>Values and Strengths</h1>
          <p>In my own research on myself(sic) it was interesting to me that that strengths, weaknesses I had years ago when starting my CompSci degree at AUT had definitely and noticeably changed. Growth mindset is not really in and of itself a -new- thing and the better application it yields across multiple domains has come down to knowledge that good education is the key to a large proportion of the world's problems. 
              Let computers handle the details of how and when information needs to be for whom and where. 
              The fun is in people and the why or at least the question of why?</p>
              
          <h1>Culture</h1>
          <p>Which brings me to culture, namely team culture. Fostering a culture of continual improvement and self-efficacy is innately essential to a team's capability AND maturity.</p>
